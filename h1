TAX REFORM AND EMPLOYEE NET PAY: Who is Affected?

Recent changes to Nigeria’s tax policy are reshaping employee net pay across organisations and sectors. 
While the reform affects everyone, the degree of impact is not uniform. Employees experience different levels of tax and net pay pressure depending on their salary band. For this reason, business owners, finance leaders and HR teams must rely on evidence-based analysis rather than assumptions.

📊 Impact by Salary Category

1️⃣Low-income earners (₦0 to ₦150,000): This group faces the least tax impact due to exemptions and reliefs. Their main challenge is not PAYE deductions but inflation, which erodes purchasing power.

2️⃣Middle-income earners (₦150,000 to ₦700,000): This category experiences the most noticeable tax pressure. Reduced take-home pay and weaker disposable income raise the likelihood of salary review requests and employee anxiety.

3️⃣Upper-income earners (₦700,000 to ₦2,500,000): These employees face higher tax deductions in value terms and increased consideration of fringe benefits. Tax planning and compensation optimisation become important to protect net pay.

4️⃣Executives (₦2,500,000 and above): This band experiences the heaviest PAYE impact, alongside potential scrutiny of allowances and perks. Strategic tax and financial planning is required rather than routine payroll adjustments.

📌 Why Organisations Should Pay Attention:
The most significant organisational risk is not compliance, but communication. Employees want clarity, transparency and fairness in how tax changes affect their income. 
Leaders must:
🔹 review compensation structures
🔹 assess net pay effects by staff level
🔹 consider necessary salary adjustments
🔹 support employee financial awareness
🔹 use payroll data to guide people decisions
